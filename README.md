# AI-Powered SQL Query Generator with Text

## Overview

This project demonstrates a web application built with Streamlit that leverages Googleâ€™s Generative AI (Gemini) to convert natural language questions into SQL queries. Users can interact with the app to ask questions about student data, which can be either pre-loaded or provided through an uploaded CSV file. The app dynamically adjusts to the schema of the uploaded data and generates SQL queries accordingly.
